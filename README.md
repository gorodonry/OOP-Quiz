# OOP-Quiz
Response to the 13DTC Project Management standard.<br><br>

## Brief
**Uncertain reward test**  
Teach basic concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python using a quiz with an "uncertain reward". In other words, it should contain an element of chance - the player could win something or lose something at each step.<br>

**Requirements**
<ol>
	<li>The program will ask a series of questions about object-oriented programming. You will come up with these yourself.</li>
	<li>With each question, include a code snippet correctly formatted with syntax, highlighting, etc.</li>
	<li>The user will click on a button to answer the question.</li>
	<li>After each question, the program offers the user a chance to earn more points (i.e. an increasing multiplier, double points, or Who Wants to be a Millionaire-style tier system).</li>
	<li>If the user answers the next question correctly, they receive their uncertain reward.</li>
	<li>If the user answers incorrectly, they do not receive their reward or even lose points.</li>
	<li>At the end of the quiz, show the user their score and congratulate them appropriately.</li>
</ol><br>
